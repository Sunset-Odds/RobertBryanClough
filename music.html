<h2>Music:</h2>

<p>I've been making music for a rather long time, but unsure if I make any consistent progress - for me its one of those things that are hard to quantify. I notice some jumps when I change equipment or improve my production, however sometimes I look back on a particular period and enjoy what I was up to a lot more than in recent years. There was a decent period of recording where I was terrible at organisation, so they are more or less lost unless I ressurect a slightly water-damaged laptop  that has no screen (-2018ish). I will add the years recorded and produced next to each song.</p>
<p>very much a work in progress - I'm inclined not to release final versions of songs. </p>

            she is the sea<br>
            back when she meant that much to me<br>
            she is the sea<br>
            capacities unreal<br>
            that’s what I was taught to feel<br>
            and now I know It wasn’t just<br>
            me in the dark<br>
            she is the sea<br>
            <br>
            life waits for me<br>
            life waits for me the moment i reach out<br>
            life waits for me<br>
            life waits for me as soon as i know<br>
            where I’m going<br>
            but where I’m coming<br>
            I don’t care I don’t care<br>
            I don’t care<br>
            <br>
            the neon light<br>
            the neon light reaches in from the shallow<br>
            neon light<br>
            the neon light talks to me<br>
            as if it were a friend and on it i depend<br>
            for light to get back<br>
            to me<br>
            the neon light<br>
            <br>
            the murky waters<br>
            the murky waters linger on in my mind<br>
            the murky waters<br>
            the murky waters call to me in my sickness<br>
            there is no cure<br>
            for feeling all of it<br>
            all the time<br>
            the murky waters<br>
            <br>
            the purple shadow<br>
            the purple shadow aches on in the pines<br>
            the purple shadow<br>
            it’s flaming arrow released from the bow<br>
            oh it struggles with my soul<br>
            and now i can’t recall a time<br>
            when it wasn’t mine<br>
            the purple shadow<br>
            <br>
            waking tomorrow<br>
            waking tomorrow out from the reeds of my dreams<br>
            waking tomorrow<br>
            <br>
            let me understand<br>
            if there is a plan i want no part of it<br>

                    why do they all come so fast <br>
                    and when i feel happy it feels so difficult<br>
                    in so many ways <br>
                    why do i have so many dreams in which i’m sick<br>
                    why do they all come at last

            can you really ask me a question<br>
            can you really talk with a straight face<br>
            under your eyes is the ocean<br>
            <br>
            is the answer really just please<br>
            is it all over my face<br>
            I just can’t repeat this notion<br>
            <br>
            am i calling back from the city<br>
            did you laugh when i tried<br>
            to receive your impressions<br>
            (even in the moments i cried)<br>
            <br>
            in the depths of the night<br>
            i talk to myself and i wait in the line<br>
            to find out my health<br>
            you know it really wasn’t a chore to stick around<br>
            but then of course<br>
            my mind is unbound<br>
            <br>
            was it really love that you were after?<br>
            was it something else off the shelf<br>
            its a mystery how we function<br>
            <br>
            there’s nothing really outside my head<br>
            cept maybe nothing at all<br>
            but that would make you an invention<br>
            <br>
            i really really thought i would make it<br>
            there’s a bit of you that did too<br>
            after mounting up the pressure<br>
            (there’s something else that came through)<br>
            <br>
            Obsessed with the rules<br>
            and how they break and change in time<br>
            and through it all down<br>
            instead of repeating words i’m out of luck<br>
            its just a game<br>
            i’m never unstuck<br>

            then i say it<br>
i say it over them<br>
i say it over<br>
i say it over again<br>
<br>
when i talk<br>
it gets<br>
easier<br>
<br>
got a little bit of effort in my toes between you<br>
then i see it in the corner and it rains before me<br>
attitude and just a little bit of light before us<br>
can you see what i was waiting for it just can’t hold on<br>
<br>
will you let me<br>
you let me follow the wind<br>
you let me follow<br>
you let my path upend<br>
<br>
when i walk<br>
it gets<br>
nearer<br>
<br>
pseudo hippocrite unburdened you waits in sorrow<br>
I’m a little bit unbrightened by your angst and rhythm<br>
on the call its just another story burnt by blindness<br>
i would never ever follow freely ropes can bind us<br>
<br>
(when we talk<br>
it gets<br>
realer)<br>
<br>
(when you leave<br>
you’re a<br>
healer)<br>
<br>
when awoken its another turn that burns unfollowed<br>
see you turning and a little hand that waves out to me<br>

            I’d like to be under the ocean sky<br>
            I’d like to be under your opened eye<br>
            Till I wither and fall into my night time<br>
            Until I die there you I want to lie<br>
            <br>
            Thats a newer way<br>
            Turn eternally<br>
            In a womans eye<br>
            Killing back then, and away<br>
            <br>
            From a darker time<br>
            And away<br>
            That was always mine<br>
            <br>
            I’d like to be untouched and left inside<br>
            Until at last I’m under breaking tides<br>
            I’d like to be awash in all your life<br>
            A letter we could write for all of time<br>
            <br>
            It’s a mouth awake<br>
            That returns to us<br>
            In a womans dream<br>
            Killing back then, and away<br>
            <br>
            From a brighter time<br>
            And away<br>
            That was always mine<br>

            From a darker time<br>
