    <h2>Writing</h2>
    <p>This is more or less going to be a dedicated database of all the writing that I'm not deeply ashamed of - I certainly won't be sharing anything creative unless I win a short story competition or something like that. And even then I will think twice. These will be some of the few pages that I'm going to be asserting my right to a copyright. Anthropologically speaking, the internet is something like a human museum, and I certainly think that my own experience of subjectivity is just as banal as any other. </p>

        <p>It's going to be hard not to sell my writing as a vague rip off of Baudrillaird - there's nothing in my writing that transcends the average critical theory podcast, and only crests on that gradient on particularly caffeinated days. It would be nice to formulise a system, but this almost certainly won't emerge until I've made many embarrasing mistakes, some of which I'm sure you can read here:</p>
