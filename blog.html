            <i>This was given as part of a workshop-style presentation on the topic of Stress as part of the Psychiatry Society in Swansea</i>
             
 <br><br>
The only main purpose of this presentation is to offer a different conception of stress. I’m trying to stay close to the material here, and I’m going to provide examples whenever I can to illustrate points. 
 <br><br>
Anything I say today will of course be anonymous, It’s up to you to speculate if some of the examples may be from my own life:
<br><br>-       Noticing a fellow medical student has fingers cracked, bleeding, bitten raw pre-exam
<br><br>-       A patient unable to recall basic facts about their condition, or history
<br><br>-       Medical students stumbling under the questions of a consultant
<br><br>-       A cannula that cannot be placed, despite the juiciest veins
 <br><br>
Stress is distinct from anxiety, but subtly so. I’m about to use jargon here, but let me keep it as a distinct formula that we can return to at the end: 
 
<br><br><i>Stress is the Desire of the Other misrecognised as Demand</i>
 
<br><br>A purely biological reading of stress would be something like: the net total of work made by an organism against homeostasis. Hans Selye defined it as “the nonspecific result of any demand made upon the body, be the effect mental or somatic”. As this theoretically is a psychiatry lecture, we can modify this, by saying that there is no such thing as a somatic effect. Or put in a different way, “If a femur fractures in a clinic, but there is no-body to hear it, does it yell out in agony?”. In his original 1936 letter to Nature, Hans Selye called it the “general alarm reaction”, or a reaction that does not correspond to the noxious substance inflicted on the organism. This will be the model for today; a kind of excess of an initial infliction. 
 
<br><br>We need to make a distinction here, between a signal and a demand. A signal stands alone, and doesn’t lay any claims to it’s ends or pathology. In the case of chronic pain, the signal can erupt spontaneously without a cause, without a pathology. We need to separate the signal of pain from the reaction; we aren’t talking about a reflex. Pain is a signal. Pain doesn’t ask for a solution, it doesn’t ask for anything, and this is why some can experience it as pleasurable. Is is pre-interpretation. The patient says to us: “I am in pain”, but in speaking, they are already in demand. A patient guards an acute abdomen, but the body is already speaking to us, If the abdomen spoke English, it’d say “there is a problem here”. This is not pain, this is Demand.  
 
<br><br>Demand is distinct from a signal in that it neccessitates a perciever; it requires an audience. A Demand is a form of communication. It requires two loci (subject a and subject b), and finally a third, in what Jacques Lacan called the Big Other. The Big Other is the virtual identity that verifies our thoughts, our speech, language itself; it imposes laws, it imposes itself without justification. We, as speaking beings, are all subject to the Big Other. If we weren’t, you wouldn’t think I was speaking at all; what you would see is something like an oddly adorned bipedal mammal, making various gestures and vocalisations. And I don’t mean to say that animals don’t talk, but as Wittgenstein said; “If a lion could talk, we would not understand”. 
 
<br><br>Materialising the Big Other in Medicine is so easy, because in Medicine it is everywhere. It is a Phantom hovering over our thoughts, our actions, our speech. To summon the ghost, merely say the magic words: “but what about the NICE guidelines?”. 
 
<br><br>A Demand invokes the Big Other, because even before the words have passed the patients lips, the Big Other has replied – this is best expressed in the uncanny realisation that when we speak, we don’t realise it, but we hear ourselves speaking, and even more uncannily; something replies. Perhaps you are somebody that talks to themselves, or know somebody that does. The operative question here would be; who are they speaking to? 
 
<br><br>Or another example: when you find yourself gesturing with your hands, even when talking on the phone. It’s not a signal, it’s a Demand, but who is listening? The Big Other. 
 
<br><br>Our patient has typically decided what is wrong with them, what the solution is, or in other words; they have already reduced the signal into a Demand. Reversing this chronology is what a history does. In effect, we have to return Demand into a Signal. Or in psychoanalystic terms, Demand is a defense against the Signal. This is what “ICE” disguises. We think that we can isolate Demand into a neat pocket of a patient history, but Demand speaks irregardless of conscious intention. Demand is everywhere. It's in how the patient is sat in bed, it’s in the facial expression of the patient listening to you, in the inflection of a voice, or a question spoken out of place. But most of all, Demand is an excess. In translation from Signal to Demand, something is lost, but something is gained. 
 
<br><br>Another jump: Demand is distinguished from Desire in that it doesn’t bring your existence into question; merely your capacity; the questions is “can I do this?”, not “What is being asked of my being?” When we fail to place a cannula, or can’t seem to find the right diagnosis, we sense that we are incapable of meeting a Demand; we meet the image of the ideal doctor, or medical student in our mind, and launch into an imaginary comparison; which at the mercy of the superego is doomed to fail. In this way, we collapse Desire into Demand, to sanitise it. It’s a kind of analgesia. Better that I fail at doing, than fail at being. It is much more tolerable, but the price is stress.  
 
<br><br>In this transformation from Desire, Demand is never satisfied. This excess of the Demand is precisely where stress makes its appearance. Desire causes anxiety, but Demand causes stress. Demand is never satisfied with what you already have done. There is always a remainder; an excess. Sometimes our positionality relative to those around us can radiate Demand even without the intervention of speech. Think of what you ask yourself when entering a new placement, a new ward, a new social group: how can I be the ideal doctor? What should I be doing? What are others like me that I admire doing in this situation, how can I be more like them? The passage from Demand into Desire would be to recognise the symbolic game of the encounter: there is no being that satisfies Demand. There is no ideal doctor. The people I admire are my own invention. The question of Desire would instead be, In knowing I am determined to fail, what is the new way in which I could fail? Or as Beckett says;
            
<br><br><i>Try again, fail again, fail better</i>
 
<br><br>So what, if anything, can be said of Demand, to let us encounter it without crumbling into stress? Firstly to recognise that the Big Other doesn’t know what it wants, even when it is speaking. The question always hides itself. Here’s a little vignette, you will all recognise it:
 
<br><br>You enter a new placement. You start a ward round with a consultant. Suddenly, they ask you a question in front of the patient. Tell me about this patient, what can you see, what do we need to know? Of course, you cannot answer precisely what they want; there is no answer that will satisfy the consultant. The question isn’t “tell me about the patient”, the question is a demand: “tell me how much I know more than you, let me prove to everybody around me that I am master in this situation”. Your answer hardly matters. The positions in the game have already been set. The game is already over. So what can we do? Realise that the hidden excess of the Demand is being placed in your arms, without your consent. Do you let the demand circulate in your body after the Demand is placed; perhaps it circles around you in the form of the superego afterwards (I cannot believe I didn’t know that diagnosis! I must revise these topics immediately, else I fail the oncoming exam!) or perhaps something even worse emerges; your answer appears to satisfy the consultant – you start to believe that you are truly “getting medicine”, that your place in the game is secure, so the next time a fellow medical student asks you a question, perhaps you start to try and be in the position of mastery yourself, and make your own Demand. Stress is a kind of linguistic inheritance, a kind of objectification that asks us to play it’s game, if only to hand it on like a hot potato. The gambit is not how long you can hold it, or how quickly you can hand it over, but to change the game entirely.
 
<br><br>Earlier I said stress is the misrecognition of Desire as Demand of the Other, but what is this Demand? The Demand is to be the plug in the hole. To seal over the cracks. The question might not be how to better modify ourselves into a human sealant; but instead to ask, what happens of the crack, the hole, the gap, should we let it remain visible? What can It tell us? And even further still, when peering into the gap, what should happen if it makes it’s own Demand?

            Chris Bell, founding member of the band Big Star produced only one solo album; 1971’s i am the cosmos. The epononymous track is a tremendous demonstration of core features of the effect of love, and how ambivelence and contradiction can be generated not through dynamic shifts or tonal breaks, but through one unified theory. I am the cosmos argues along the lines of Slavoj Zizek, who argues that love is a violent disaster that not only destabilises the symbolic frame of the subject, but destabilises the imaginary properties of the subject itself, rendering bare the split at the core of subjectivity. Resistent to an instantaneous maxim, Bell’s encounter with love is at once narcissistic, displacing and transformative. 
        
        <br><br>Take care to notice the album cover already is rich in signification; the bold Arial Fontwork of CHRIS BELL against the entirely lowercase i am the cosmos, foreshadows capriciousness whilst demonstrating the tragedy at the heart of Freudian narcissism; that it is through self-aggrandisement, not through repression, that the subject encounters it’s own limit in the field via powerful cathetic love-object choices. The object of affection is at once extraordinarily personal and yet alien and unencounterable. Though the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan makes several coherent demonstrations that love can be discretely imaginary, symbolic or real, the fracture that love presents is an interweaving of the three. The encounter with love is imaginary; we fantasize about our object of affection, dream of unity and the non-lack, yet it is also symbolic; our fantasies render us in a particular relationship to the gaze of the Other, and love mocks these relationships – our “type”, our “preferences”, our “red-flags” suddenly become negotiable, even our most private wishes and dreams may suddenly be recast in our assumption of the returned love of the chosen object. But let’s make an important qualifier here:  as Leon Brenner says [1], there is no promise of the return of our love from the Other, only a reciperocation in a mathmatical sense; our numerator (dream, wishes, plans, preferences) are subject to a violent reciperocal of our displacing love. In this sense, as he says, when the subject loves, they are enamoured. Love returns akin to the return of the symbolic in psychosis from the outside-in, accounting for Clérembault’s syndrome, otherwise known as Erotomania.
        
        <br><br>Erotomania is the deepest expression of love returning from the “other-side” and is perfectly encountered by Bell’s ex-bandmate, Alex Chilton, in his song Dream Lover:
        
        <br><br><i>“You’re a dream lover,
        and I’m never gonna let you go…
        … the real, so real 
        Scene twixt me and you
        And I wake up and shiver
        A lonely quiver 
        And I don’t know where to look”</i><br><br>
        
        Chilton initially explores Erotomania in the context of the dream, but stages it as a classic encounter with fantasy that neatly reflects Zizek’s assessment of fantasy as the means by which we encounter reality through staging it both as a theatrical space (“scene twixt me and you”) whilst insisting in its reality: pay attention to Chilton’s infliction where “real, so real” misses by a hairs length the metonymic echo of “real, surreal” – a substitution with not only a warehouse of similar conclusions in popular music but equally an accurate debt to the etmology of surreal as “above reality” – akin to Freud’s Uber-Ich, the fantasy locates itself superimposed above reality topologically, which in the theatre of the subjects, in whose hunt for unity provides the basis for erotomania itself, which can be defined as the moment in which the two registers structurally merge. 
        
        <br><br> Erotomania is roughly speaking, extremely rare, but what stops this merging in the subject, when they encounter love from the “Other side”? Lacan’s quest to invite German Idealism into psychoanalysis provides an askance answer; Hegel’s nothing as productive, or in Lacanese, lack as engine of Desire, which he roughly compares to the second law of thermodynamics, or “die Entropie der Welt strebt einem Maximum zu” [2]. Desire seeks to “fill in the gaps” of our experience, in efforts to return to the foremost Lacanian myth of the subject, Das Ding; an illusory realm of pure presence, in which nothing is lacking, and we are enraptured in pure edenic bliss. Correctly, many commentators compare this experience to that of death, and that in the Freudian sense life, or human reality, is a kind of aberrant surplus, or as Zizek echoes; 
        
        <br><br><i>“…the universe is a void, but a kind of positively charged void, then particular things appear when the balance of the void is disturbed… the fact that it’s not just nothing, things are out there, it means something went terribly wrong” [3]. <br><br></i>
        
            This conception of reality, in which abberant matter disturbs the void, permits Hegel’s notion of the dielectic between being and nothing, a space that permits a kind of topological sandwich between superimposed concepts of the subject. When love returns to us from the Other side, reality is encounter through fantasy, and the difference of one from the other enables the subject to oscillate through both, without resolution in either. A type of superposition in which the subject may experience love as both a fantasy of unity and a violent break with reality.
        
            <br><br> Bell expresses this clearly in the lyrical and emotional climax of the song in which the split subject is made bare; 
        
            <br><br><i> “I never want to see you again,
            I really want to see you again”<br><br></i>
        
            Some commentators have argued that these lyrics are demonstrative of Bell’s struggle with repressed homosexuality, but there is a truth that transcends object-choice; when we love, we love as an act from a place of total embodied subjectivity and alien encounter – we act in spite of ourselves, or in fidelity to a domain that is at once innate and ectopic.

            Undoubtedly one of the strangest features of the 21st century is the endurance of the explanatory powers of classical Psychoanalytic concepts. With the arrival of the internet, writings in the late 80s and 90s are brimming with a Deleuzian optimism of things yet to come – new possibilities and openings accessible via the rapid dissemination of publicly available information. The promise goes like this: the public, now have unbridled and uncensored access to what is conceivably the largest library ever constructed by humans. An oddly alien form of a library – one in which the books sort and resort themselves, contradict and manifest new categories – something like the sliding staircases in the Harry Potter series. Information, data and scientific progress will now generate its own perpetual motion, an artificial identity that necessitates its own progress.<br><br>
        
            We may reply to this assessment with the valid question of where in this dynamic mesh do we find the human. The problem has already been solved by Lacan’s inversion of the sign: <br><br>qu'un signifiant est ce qui représente un sujet, là, pour un autre signifiant. [1]<br><br> The “là” in question being the site of language, the Symbolic order, or what can be in ordinary language described as the entity of language itself; a dynamic agreement of language bounded by laws that structure not only our relationship to language (and therefore Freud’s unconscious), but our own “reality” as it is encountered as such. Lacan routinely stresses that the subject is not the autonomous presence here (or as he puns in Seminar V, we are <i>subject</i>-ed, akin to the English language usage of population and its monarch). This encounter with the Other of language is distinguished from a notion of a scientific “view from nowhere” by insisting that it is both a product of humans and an uncannily ectopic from the individual – Lacan insists that a man alone on a desert island still has an Other - by contrast with the Jungian notion of a “collective unconscious”.<br><br>
            
            This now gives us a new conceptual focus on how we encounter the internet as individuals: the internet escapes the utopian promise of the 90s whilst still sufficiently meeting the criteria. Yes, we can access unbridled data and information at our fingertips daily, but in this unbridled access we encounter the sensation of being a displaced node in a network, akin to Lacan’s subject in the network of signifiers. To misapprehend the modern subject as an autonomous node not only misses the point but carries ideological weight for notions of the sovereign individual already made redundant in the 19th century by Marx’s economical insights.<br><br>
            
            To summarise the argument in brief:  we are subjects of the internet, or more appropriately <i>subjected</i> to the internet that is an “Other” that both appears as ectopic and requires us for its existence. Subjectivity has internalised the internet as a structure akin to our fundamental relationship with language. The contemporary displacement of the subject (or in Marxian terms its alienation) misrecognised as utopian progress is instead another encounter with the Other of language, therefore rendering psychoanalytic concepts not only explanatory, but as an analysis that has already taken place. The job of updating these concepts is similar to the mathematical concept of translation in which relations are merely repositioned within the same axis.
