    <h3>Currently Reading (2026):</h3>
        <small id="indented-text">Trying to only keep stuff on this list that I'm genuinely interested in finishing; I'm trying not to bend in to the Superego urge to treat it more like a checklist than anything. I'm much more comfortable with the idea of reading 10% of 50 books than forcing myself through 5 books and resenting it. I generally have something I'm doing more of a deep read on, then a bajillion other interests that are much more salience based. </small>
    <ul>
        <li>Lacan SXII</li>
            <small id="indented-text">This is the second Lacan lecture I'm reading in French, so not eagerly rushing into it. SXII was so dense in an odd way despite being a lot more clear than many other lectures, that I'm a bit burnt out. </small>
        <li>Phänomenologie des Geistes</li>
            <small id="indented-text">I've started reading this in German, but really struggling to parse the language. Treating this a little bit more like my reading of Wittgenstein - reading a few paragraphs and letting it simmer for a while</small>
        <li>Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung</li>
        <li>Das Kapital Kritik Der Politischen Ökonomie</li>
        <li>Calculus : First Transcendentals</li>
            <small id="indented-text">Alongside this I've started to read Vellmann's proof book. Between the two, I'm feeling a lot more confident launching into different areas of maths; my analytic work is still trash; but to be honest for the next few months I'm busy with medical exams so just cursorily reading</small>
        <li>How to Prove it; a structured approach</li>
        <li>Undergraduate Physics Including Modern Physics</li>
            <small id="indented-text">Started reading this alongside openstax free online textbooks - I still like the pencil to paper approach but as mentioned above, I'm just reading for curiosity rather than developments at the moment.</small>         
        <li>God Emporer of Dune</li>
        <li>Wings of the Dove</li>
        <li>Slavery and Social Death</li>
        <li>Transgender Psychoanalysis</li>
        <li>The Half has never been told</li>
        <li>Global Masculinities and Manhood</li>
        <li>The Yoga Sutras of Patanjalis</li>
        <li>Either/Or</li>
        <li>Reading Seminars I and II</li>
            <small id="indented-text">As mentioned above a bit burnt out on Lacan</small>
        <li>For a critique of the political economy of the sign</li>
            <small id="indented-text">Honestly feel like my Marx is too shocking to read and understand this. Might come back after Das Kapital. Also tempted to try and read Baudrillaird in original French as a bit of practice</small>
        <li>French for Reading and Translation</li>
        <li>German for Reading Knowledge</li>
            <small id="indented-text">My language work on the above two languages has predictably moved a different direction again; I'm using closemaster for German, readlang and reading primary texts for French, managed to go out to france last month too; felt that my general skill has improved, especially reading</small>
        <li>The Peloponnesian War</li>
        <li>Neuromancer</li>
        <li>Love, Guilt and Reparation and other works 1921 - 1945</li>
            <small id="indented-text">Maybe moving to a different analyst might be a bit of a cure for my Lacan malaise; tempted by both Klein and Winnicot</small>
        <li>Postmodernism or The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism</li>
        <li>The hundred years war on Palestine</li>
        <li>A History of Psychology</li>
        <li>A Closed and Common Orbit</li>
        <li>The three body problem</li>
        <li>L'étranger</li>
        <li>Being and time</li>
        <li>Écrits</li>
        <li>Holy Bible</li>
        <li>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</li>
        <li>Politics (Aristotle)</li> 
        <li>Cours de linguistique générales</li>
    </ul>
