    <h3>Currently Reading (2025):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><s>Seminar IV</s></li>
            <small id="indented-text">Not particulary a standout seminar in terms of new concepts, but a thorough dig through one of Freud's work - this time Little Hans</small>
        <li><s>Seminar V</s></li>
            <small id="indented-text">I've been rather busy these past few months, but as usual have found time for Lacan. Think I actually understand the Graph of Desire less than I did before reading this. </small>
        <li><s>Seminar VI</s></li>
            <small id="indented-text">Precisely what I felt was missing from Seminar V - the signifier unusually isn't that present here - It's instead wrapped up alongside the general Jargon. I had to go back and reread thedangeorousmaybe's blog post on the Phallus to make sense of some parts of this</small>
        <li><s>Seminar VII</s></li>
            <small id="indented-text">I've been waiting a rather long time for this one. I originally started from X->XI, and then returned back to I - It almost feels like arriving at calculus for the first time. </small>
        <li><s>Seminar VIII</s></li>
            <small id="indented-text">Bit of a quieter one after VII - got touted as the Seminar to figure out Lacan's theory of love, but think I might have to wait a little longer to let that notion have some form. Lining up Fink's book to follow.</small>
        <li><s>Seminar IX</s></li>
                        <small id="indented-text">That's it for IX. Took me about 4 months to read it all - first seminar or book generally read through completely in French. </small>
        <li>Seminar X</li>
        <small id="indented-text">I've already read this, the first I read ever. I'm hoping to get more out of it this time</small>
        <li>Phänomenologie des Geistes</li>
        <li>Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung</li>
        <li>Das Kapital Kritik Der Politischen Ökonomie</li>
        <li>Calculus : First Transcendentals</li>
        <small id="indented-text">Calculus II goes so hard.</small>
        <li><s>Is it just ever sex?</s></li>
        <small id="indented-text"> I really like Darian Leader. I'm also very fond of the trajectory of his work in the sense that over time he has become more concise and readable, instead of the opposite. As an example compare <i>why do women write more letters than they post?</i> to this.</small>
        <li>Undergraduate Physics Including Modern Physics</li>
        <li>Prove It : A Structured Approach</li>
        <li>God Emporer of Dune</li>
        <li><s>Portrait of a Lady</s></li>
        <small id="indented-text"> I really, really enjoyed this. It just took so damn long to read. I'm having issues with fiction at the moment. </small>
        <li>Slavery and Social Death</li>
        <li>Transgender Psychoanalysis</li>
        <li>The Half has never been told</li>
        <li>Global Masculinities and Manhood</li>
        <li>The Yoga Sutras of Patanjalis</li>
        <li>Either/Or</li>
        <li>Reading Seminars I and II</li>
        <li>For a critique of the political economy of the sign</li>
        <small id="indented-text">Honestly feel like my Marx is too shocking to read and understand this. Might come back after Das Kapital. Also tempted to try and read Baudrillaird in original French as a bit of practice</small>
        <li>French for Reading and Translation</li>
        <li>German for Reading Knowledge</li>
        <small id="indented-text">For both of the above books I've gone a bit of a different direction - focusing on really basic A1 stuff for German, and for French I've found a b1/b2 course on Coursera that's free. I'll come back to these titles when I've made a bit of progress here.</small>
        <li>The Peloponnesian War</li>
        <li><s>The Autistic Subject On the Threshold of Language</s></li>
        <small id="indented-text">really enjoying this one - looking forward to creating a critique of section 6, without derailing the overall project, which I see a lot of possibility for the future</small>
        <li>Neuromancer</li>
        <li>Love, Guilt and Reparation and other works 1921 - 1945</li>
        <li>Postmodernism or The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism</li>
        <li>The hundred years war on Palestine</li>
        <li>A History of Psychology</li>
        <li><s>The long way to a small angry planet</s></li>
        <li>
        <small id="indented-text">Liked this as a sci-fi that focused on customs and linguistic differences as the core of relationships without devolving into a "we're all the same" style rhetoric</small>
        <li>A Closed and Common Orbit</li>
        <li>The three body problem</li>
        <li>L'étranger</li>
        <li>Being and time</li>
        <li>Écrits</li>
        <li>Holy Bible</li>
        <li>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</li>
        <li>Politics (Aristotle)</li> 
        <li>Cours de linguistique générales</li>
        <li><s>You don't have to be mad to work here</s></li>
