<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>The study of sense of
the texts and on our teaching</p></b>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The search for meaning was practiced, for example by certain
buddhist masters with the Zen technique. The master interrupts the silence by
anything, a joke, a kick. It belongs to the pupils to themselves to find an
appropriate response to the study of<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the
texts, the master doesn’t teach<i> ex cathedra </i>a readymade science but
gives the solution when the students are on the moment of finding it. This
teaching is a refusal of a whole system, it discovers a thought through the
progress of its movement, but nethertheless readies a system, because it is
obliged to present a certain dogmatic face. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The thought of Freud is perpetually open to revision. Its an
error to reduce it to a words usage : unconscious, super ego… Each notion
posses itself its own life; that which is called precisely the dielectic : it
has a contradiction, etc. Yet certain notions are for Freud, in a given moment,
essential : they provide a response to a question formulated in prior
expression.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It doesn’t suffice to make the history of meaning the
history of thought and say that Freud has emerged in a scientific century. With
the science of dreams, something of a different essence, of a density
concretely psychological, is reintroduced, namely meaning. From the scientific
point of view, Freud seems to join a thought that is very archaic : to read
something in dreams. In response to this, Freud returns a causal argument. But
when we interpret a dream, we are filled with meaning, with something that is
fundamental to the subject, something in subjectivity, its desires, its
relationship to its environment, and life itself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our task is the reintroduction of the register of meaning, a
register that must be restored at its proper level. Brücke, Ludwig, Helmholts,
Du Bois-Reymond have already constructed a type of professed faith : </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i>“Everything
returns to the the physical forces. Those of attraction and of repulsion”<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we give ourselves this premise, there is no reason to
leave. If Freud has departed it, its because he has found other data: He had
dared to attach importance to that which arrived with him, for example the
antinomies of his childhood, to his neurotic disorders, to his personal dreams.
It’s that which Freud is, and is for us too, a man placed in the centre of the
most human contingencies : death, the woman, the father.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This contitues a return to the basics and hardly merits the
title of science. It is like a good chef, which knows well how to cut the
animal, to remove joints with the least resistance (Plato : Phadrus, 265e). For
each structure, we grant a type of conceptualisation which is appropriate to
it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We are nonetheless on the path of a
complication and one has a preference to return the simpler monist deduction of
the world. Nevertheless, it must be discerned that it isn’t with the knife that
we dissect but with concepts : concept that order an original reality. The
concepts don’t arise without the human experience, otherwise they will be “well
done”. The first denominations are made by setting out with words, these are
the instruments to delineate things. <i>Thus all science rests with forever in
the night, tangled in language</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lavoisier, for example, at the same time that he was a
phylogistician, contributed the concept of oxygen. There is first a human
language completely formed for us, which we treat like a a bad instrument. From
time to time it performs a reversal : from phylogistry to oxygen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Language must always introduce symbols, mathmatical or
otherwise, alongside the contemporary language, it must explain that which we
want to do. We are therefore at the level of a certain human exhange, the
theraputic one, which Freud found despite his constitution. Like Jones has
demonstrated, Freud imposed on himself an asceticism that didn’t pour out on
the speculative domain from his strong nature, he submitted to a discipline
that was made inside the laboratory : It pulled away from <i>mauvaise langue</i>.
But consider the notion of the subject : when one introduces it, one introduces
at the same time, the man who you speak and man like the others, it takes from <i>mauvaise
langue. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From the outset, Freud knew that he will make no progress
with analysis of the neuroses unless he analyses himself. The growing
importance attributed to the counter transference signifies the reconnaissance
of the fact there are two of us in analysis, not just two phenonemonologically,
it’s a structure : because of that certain phenomena are isolable, seperable.
It’s the structure of subjectivity which has given to man this idea that they
are comprehensible to themselves. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being neurotic can help to become a good psychoanalyst :
from the start it offered a service to Freud. Like Mr. Jourdain with his
writing, we make sense, we make a contra-sense, we make nonsense. Again there
we find the lines of structure. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jung too discovered there with a sense of wonder, in <i>the
symbols of dreams and religious symbols, </i>certain archetypes specific to the
human species. Freud introduces another thing, determinisim specific to this
levelicity of structure. Of the ambiguity which one one finds again and again
everywhere in his oeuve, for example : the dream is – his desire or the
reconnaissance of his desire?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Or again, the ego is at one time like a hollow ego,
differentiated at its surface at the contact of world of the perception and
also, each time that we come across it, that which says “no”, or “I am”, it’s
the same that says “we”, which speaks to the others, which expresses itself
underneath these different registers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have followed the techniques of an art of dialogue : like
a good chef, we know the joints, the resistances we come across. The super ego
is also a law deprived of sense, but in rapport with the problemes of language.
If I speak, I say : “you take a right” to allow him to reach an agreement of <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>his language with mine, I think of that which
passes through his head at the moment in which I speak to him : this effort
agrees with the communication proper to language. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This “you” is so much fundamental to that which intervenes
before consciousness. The censure, for example, is intentional, it plays before
consciousness, it functions with vigilance. “You” is not a signal, but a
reference to the <i>autre, </i>it is order and love. Of the same Ideal-ego is
an organism of defence perpetuated by the ego to prolong the satisfaction of
the subject. It is also the function the most depressing, in the psychaitric
sense of the term. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Id is not reducible to a pure given objective, but to
the pulsion of the subject : never an analysis hasn’t succeeded without heights
of aggresivity or eroticism. It’s a certain point in the dielectic of progress
of analysis, the extreme point of existential recognition : “you are this”, an
ideal reached before the end of analysis. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is not<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the
command of an authentic self, the absence of passion. The ideal analysis is a
rendering of the subject capable of remembering the analytic dialogue, of
speaking not too early, or not too late, its that which is to aim at a didactic
analysis. The introduction of an order of purpose to the human existence, in
the domain of sense, which is called the reason.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The discovery of Freud, it’s the rediscovery, on a wasteland,
of reason. </p>
