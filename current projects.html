    <h2>Mathematics</h2>
    <p>Generally speaking, I really enjoy maths - I always come up with some kind of excuse for enjoying it - "I love it's application to topics I work with" "Its a great way of learning other language-led disciplines (programming, logic etc)" 
    <br><br> And generally speaking, yes, mathmatics has an almost excrutiating amount of applicability - in that sense it's closer to philosophy its its spread. It also shares many features with the creative arts, and there is a constant to and fro of communication between the two, simply put, a good mathmatical formula is like a good poem, or line of a novel, it can condense deeply complex topics sometimes into a few letters. It permits itself this by maintaining both a rigidity and an openness. Think of the diverse applications of the pythagoras theorem - all sticking rigidly to the same formula, but bearing on formula as diverse as mechanics to dance.</p>
    <h3>Currently learning</h3>
    <p>My original goal was to get to a standard of mathematics where I could engage with Calculus, and my prior assumption was that meeting this standard stood me in good stead to understand topics further astray, such as Topology or the work of Gödel. It turns out that this was deeply mistaken, but coming to that knowledge was a valid journey in and of itself. It reifies the idea that I came to quite early in my philosophy journey in that most learning is parallel to Zeno's Achilles' paradox, in which the area or topic of knowledge aimed at progresses in the process of attempting to reach it - consequently causing a forever fleeting horizon. On the way, retrospective checkpoints appear naive - here I'm drawing somewhat on Hegel's concept of natural consciousness, in which previous moments of spirit are encountered for the second time as trivial an childish notions. This idea is proved by spending even a few moments around highly completent people in most professions. 
        <br> <br> Therefore, I am currently attempting what roughly equates to a North American Undergraduate Major in Mathematics. This includes roughly (as adapted from https://www.susanrigetti.com/math): <br><br>
            <b>Four semesters of calculus<br> 

            An “introduction to proofs” course<br>
            
            Linear algebra<br>
            
            Two semesters of algebra<br>
            
            Real Analysis<br>
            
            Complex Analysis<br>
            
            Ordinary Differential Equations<br>
            
            Partial Differential Equations<br></b>

    <h2>Physics</h2>
    <p>My interest in physics is somewhat is in someway similar to my transition from Psychology - In a last ditch attempt to ground myself in applicability and the material world, Physics is <i>for my own good</i>. I would love to spend more time on physics, and no doubt I will come to it in more of a major way if I pursue the neuroscientific end of my own discipline. Again, I would like to reach the level necessary to be able to encounter theories and physical concepts with some degree of confidence, or as the Serenity prayer goes: the wisdom to know the difference. Here is a list of what is encountered in a typical Physics Undergraduate course in the US:</p>
    <br><br><b>Introduction to Mechanics<br>

        Electrostatics<br>
        
        Waves and Vibrations<br>
        
        Modern Physics<br>
        
        Classical Mechanics<br>
        
        Electrodynamics<br>
        
        Quantum Mechanics<br>
        
        Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics<br>
        
        Undergraduate Electives</b>
